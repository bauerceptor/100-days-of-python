# 100 Days of Python

Welcome to the 100 Days of Python repository! Here, you'll find a collection of Python projects, exercises, and side projects designed to help you learn and master the Python programming language and its ecosystem.

## Overview

This repository is inspired by the [100 Days of Code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge, with a focus on Python. The goal is simple: to dedicate time each day to coding in Python for 100 days straight. Whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced developer looking to expand your skills, this challenge is for you.

Throughout the 100 days, you'll not only build a new Python project every day but also dive into various exercises to solidify your understanding of Python fundamentals. Additionally, you'll tackle side projects aimed at exploring important areas of programming such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Functional Programming, and advanced Python concepts like list comprehensions, generators, declarative classes, and more.

## Why Python?

Python is a versatile and powerful programming language that's widely used in various domains, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, artificial intelligence, automation, and more. By mastering Python, you'll open up countless opportunities in the world of software development and beyond.

## Structure of the Repository

- **Projects**: Each day, you'll find a new Python project. Some Projects that use multiple files even have their own dedicated directories. These projects will cover a wide range of topics and applications, allowing you to explore different aspects of Python programming.
  
- **Exercises**: In addition to projects, there are exercises aimed at reinforcing your understanding of Python syntax, data structures, algorithms, and more. These exercises are designed to be challenging yet rewarding, helping you grow as a Python programmer.
  
- **Side Projects**: As you progress through the challenge, you'll encounter side projects that delve deeper into specific areas of programming. These projects will give you hands-on experience with important concepts such as OOP, Functional Programming, and advanced Python features.
